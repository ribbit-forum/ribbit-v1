## Inspiration 🐸
Leap into the future of social networking with Ribbit! In a world saturated with traditional social media, we're ushering in a new era of Web3 innovation. Ribbit is not just a platform but a leap towards a new world of privacy and security. Dive in and securely share your thoughts, like never seen before. 

## What It Does 🚀
Ribbit, our innovative social network, leverages Web3 technologies such as Starknet to provide users with a completely anonymous and secure space for content sharing.

## How We Built It 🔧
We built Ribbit with a combination of technologies, including:
 Javascript
 Python
 Next.js
 Starkware / Starknet: Secure authentication
 Cairo Smart Contracts: Allows users to interact with posts
 PostgreSQL: Automatically save user sessions

## Challenges We Ran Into ⛰️
Navigating the integration process posed a considerable challenge to our team, given the learning curve that came with learning Flow and Starknet. We found the hurdle of outdated documentation for Starknet and the lack of SDK support added additional layers of complexity.
Despite these obstacles, we persevered and worked collaboratively to find solutions and alternatives to ensure the successful execution of Ribbit!

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of 💪
 Perseverance
 Strong team morale (With our team motto of "Just one more day!")

## What We Learned 📚
We are proud to have learned how to work in different roles under time pressure, and pushing through difficult situations together. Despite the hiccups along the way, this experience has proven to be both valuable and fulfilling. This has been a particularly rewarding opportunity to apply our skills, within tight timelines. Confronting and overcoming challenges together has not only strengthened our team but also allowed us to glean meaningful insights. We are proud of our swift progress and accomplishments, considering our limited prior experience with hackathons.

## What's Next for Ribbit 🔮
We are excited to see what the future of Ribbit may hold. We hope to improve the user experience by implementing mutimedia support to remove restrictions in how our users may seek to express their thoughts. We also would like to implement tipping using FLOW, to allow users to securely and directly show support for the communities that they are apart of.
